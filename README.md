# MS Teams Observability — Dynatrace Application

The **MS Teams Observability Dynatrace Application** provides ready-to-use visualizations to monitor Microsoft Teams inside **Dynatrace**.

It helps organizations analyze user experience, detect performance degradations, correlate Microsoft service incidents and support troubleshooting workflows across operational and engineering teams.

The application consumes telemetry from the [**MS Teams Observability Agent**](https://github.com/Phenisys/microsoft-teams-observability), which collects enriched call quality metrics from Microsoft Teams.  

The application can also run in **demo mode** using built-in sample data for evaluation or presentations without requiring the agent.
